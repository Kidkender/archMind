  review: `Respond with a JSON object matching this schema exactly:

{
  "finding_type": "<string describing the issue type — e.g. missing_authorization, race_condition, transaction_leak, stale_cache, or any type that accurately names the problem>",
  "severity": "<CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW>",
  "confidence": "<HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW>",
  "explanation": "<markdown string — 2-4 paragraphs, developer-audience>",
  "key_nodes": ["<symbol>", ...],
  "recommendations": ["<actionable fix>", ...],
  "uncertainty": "<null or one sentence if uncertain>"
}

Rules:
- "finding_type" should name the real issue found — do NOT invent vague types, but DO name types the detector list above missed if you see them in the code.
- "key_nodes" must be the exact identifier shown first on each node line in the Execution path section (e.g. "auth:sanctum", "OrderController::store" — not the bracketed type label).
- Write explanation for a senior developer reading a PR review.
- First paragraph: what the finding is and where it occurs.
- Second paragraph: why it matters.
- Third paragraph (optional): when it is acceptable.
- If source code snippets are shown, reason about the actual implementation — not just the graph structure.`,

Rules:
- "finding_type" should name the real issue — go beyond the detector list if the code shows something else.
- "key_nodes" must be the exact identifier shown first on each node line in the Execution path section (e.g. "auth:sanctum", "OrderController::store" — not the bracketed type label).
- Write for a junior developer — explain what each node does before explaining the problem.
- Use numbered steps or analogies to clarify execution order.
- If source code snippets are shown, walk through the actual code.`,

Rules:
